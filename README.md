# XDisPlace
XDisplace are a complete solution to mill, dispense solder paste and pixk and place components to a pcb in one process!

I made a long video playlist to explain all my steps to develop this Feature. Please watch it:

A nice explain why XDisPlace exists from this website: http://nerdclub-uk.blogspot.de/2016/06/sacrificing-pins-to-make-pcb-layout.html


Wherever possible, we like to try to keep to single-sided boards, even for designs going "into production". While it's easy to throw together a poorly-designed, double-sided PCB and send it off to a factory to get made up, that means delays and waiting; and quite often, a much slower development cycle - particularly if, like us, you have an iterative design process!

Keeping designs to single-sides means you can knock up some ferric chloride, try out your design and have a working board in hours, not days or even weeks.

But even if your project isn't time sensitive and you can afford to wait weeks, between ordering and receiving your boards, it often means either:

a) when the board needs redesigning (because you forgot to include the ground plane, or re-route that pin you left a "to-do" note against and then ignored - don't pretend it hasn't happened) you've got another four-to-six-week wait while the new boards arrive OR

b) tack-soldering a few wires and slicing traces with a craft knife, just to get the thing up and working.

Either way, you end up with a less-than ideal PCB or weeks and months of delays.
Homebrew etching is ugly. The results are less than perfect. It's messy and you'll stain your hands yellow for days (and possibly the sink forever if you're not careful). But it gets a result - quickly.

So if you need to redesign a board, you can simply print out a new design, slap down some toner transfer, whack it in some ferric chloride and an hour or two later, you've an amended design. And once you're absolutely sure your design works, you can send the exact same PCB layout to your favourite factory/fab-house and then wait (one time only) for the nice, shiny, silk-screened-and-solder-masked versions to arrive, for the final product.

That's why we still make our own PCBs.
It might not be fashionable (in fact there are plenty people who ask why, when having PCBs manufactured is so cheap, would you want to still etch your own boards) but it is quick and allows the iterative design process to complete fully - no boards with bits of wires tacked on because we've committed to a single design now (even with faults/errors) and can't wait any longer to get the thing soldered up and tested! That's why we favour single-sided designs.
